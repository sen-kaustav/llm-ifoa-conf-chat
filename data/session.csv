2025-11-05,14:10 - 15:10,Plenary 1,FCA on Consumer Duty,"
In a post-Consumer Duty world, it is expected that all insurers act to deliver good customer outcomes. This has been a material change to the regulatory landscape and has required considerable resource from firms to implement. 
To build on this, the FCA has recently launched its strategy for the next five years. This will focus on four key areas:   
Being a smarter regulator 
Helping consumers 
Fighting financial crime 
Supporting growth 
Speakers from the FCA will explain how these areas will drive the work programme for life insurance supervision and build on the Consumer Duty.
They will share some specific areas that will be the focus for the next five years and enable the audience to get an early insight into why these areas have been chosen. 
The session will be interactive, allowing the audience to contribute questions to the speakers.

Mental health is no longer just a wellbeing issue – it’s a strategic imperative for insurers. With rising claims, increased public awareness, and growing demand for support across all demographics, insurers have a pivotal role to play in reshaping how mental health is approached across prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. 
We will explore the evolving role of insurers in addressing mental health from a holistic and long-term perspective. Drawing on insights from across the insurance value chain – including pricing, product design, claims, digital health, and customer engagement – we’ll discuss how insurers can move from reactive claims management to proactive, personalised mental health support. 
We’ll share practical examples and emerging innovations, including digital tools for early intervention, integration of mental health within broader health products, and the challenges and opportunities in underwriting and product strategy.  
The session will discuss the responsibilities insurers have under the Consumer Duty and ESG agendas, and how mental health investment can promote long-term customer outcomes and sustainable growth. 
This talk offers a multi-faceted, real-world view of the current state – and future possibilities – for mental health in insurance.

2025-11-05,16:40 - 17:25,Workshop A5,Global macro pivot: impact on UK pensions and insurance?,"
The recent shift in the global macro narrative – driven by the prospect of renewed Trump-era tariffs – marks a potential turning point in market dynamics. Proposals range from sweeping 10% tariffs on all imports to targeted 60% levies on Chinese goods. We’re entering an environment that could reshape inflation expectations, trade flows, and central bank reaction functions. While this might initially seem like a US-centric development, the implications for UK institutional investors are real and underappreciated. 
This session will explore how these global currents interact with the UK’s long-duration balance sheets – particularly for insurers and pension schemes. Rising inflation risks, diverging monetary policy paths between the Fed and BoE, and volatility in real rates all have knock-on effects on solvency positions, funding ratios, and hedging strategies. 
Key discussion points will include: 
The potential revaluation of inflation-linked liabilities 
Cross-border capital shifts and their impact on GBP asset markets 
Implications for strategic asset allocation and regulatory capital efficiency 
How insurers and pension funds might respond – defensively or opportunistically – to a more fragmented global economy 
This is not a forecast – it’s a framework. One that asks whether existing portfolio and balance sheet strategies are robust enough to navigate a world that may be returning to old patterns of geopolitical and economic rivalry.

Is open-source software truly a viable alternative to traditional vendor-maintained offerings? We will look at the reasons for choosing open source, supported with AI, as a preferred method of implementation when we onboarded a recent new client. We will look at the decisions and choices from both the company’s designated chief actuary and the implementation partners’ viewpoints. 
We will present our thoughts and findings by answering several key questions related to the process: 
How did we determine open source as the preferred option in this case? 
What were the perceived risks of using a fairly new approach? 
Did we approach the implementation any differently? 
What were the pros and cons along the way? 
Did we achieve everything we set out to? 
There will be time at the end for further questions from the audience to both the chief actuary and the implementation partner lead.

2025-11-06,11:10 - 11:55,Workshop B1,A lifetime of risk ,"
Health outcomes depend not only on whether we are exposed to a risk factor, but crucially on how much exposure we have, and for how long. A smoker’s morbidity and mortality risk is shaped by the number of cigarettes smoked and the timing of that exposure over their lifetime. Similarly, an overweight individual’s risk depends on both the duration and the degree of excess weight. 
Most traditional risk models rely only on current risk factor exposure (for example, proportion of smokers), ignoring exposure history.  
We present ‘lifetime exposure modelling’, a novel hazards-based approach that quantifies risk based on lifetime exposure history incorporating the amount of exposure, when it occurs, and how its impact changes over time. This presentation will focus on its application in analysing and projecting population mortality trends under different scenarios. Using age, period, and cohort analysis of risk factor trajectories, we combine this with biomedical evidence to estimate future disease-specific mortality based on lifetime exposure patterns across different cohorts. 
Lifetime exposure modelling offers actuaries an intuitive way to quantify long term risk, capturing not just where people are today, but how they got there. This approach has broad application across pricing, reserving and risk management. We invite you to explore how it can enhance your own modelling, inform strategic decisions, and bring fresh insight into the drivers of future population health.

2025-11-06,11:10 - 11:55,Workshop B5,Evaluating the predictive power of postcodes and pension amounts in m+A10ortality analysis ,"
Geo-demographic risk factors based on residential postcode have been used in the UK’s pension risk transfer market for nearly two decades, while pension amount has been around for many decades prior. Postcode modelling that seeks to explain socio-economic mortality differentials appears to take a second seat to the pension amount risk factor, at least as far as in explaining past mortality experience. But as most pension schemes are now closed to new members and long-term tenure among future pensioners becomes increasingly rare, the predictive power of pension amounts in determining mortality differentials is gradually diminishing. 
Can enhanced postcode models take over as the most predictive risk factor? 
In a collaborative study, Nay Wynn of SCOR Global Life Re and Stefan Ramonat of Ad Res Advanced Reinsurance Services leverage the largest ever set of mortality data curated by LexisNexis Risk Solutions.
They explore:  
How we can measure the predictive power of different postcode models 
To what extent do refined postcode models explain mortality differentials between pension schemes? 
Whether there is a means to predict pension amount using geo-demographic information gleaned from big data 
Whether we can find a general predictive model for pension risk that avoids the pitfalls of pension amount while still predicting the differences in mortality between various pension schemes 
Join us in this insightful workshop session as we delve into multiple case studies, uncovering answers and gaining practical insights.  Actuaries at all levels will benefit from the real-world applications of these findings in pension risk transfer pricing.

Actuaries often focus on the technical aspects of data analysis and modelling when setting long-term future assumptions. But biases and implicit subjectivity can result in sub-optimal assumptions, despite the use of even the most technically sophisticated methods.  
This presentation will consider ways to help combat these problems and thereby improve the reliability and robustness of assumptions in the face of significant uncertainty.
Specific issues that will be covered include: 
How relying on data does not necessarily remove subjectivity and how best to deal with this by making conscious decisions and applying healthy scepticism  
Behavioural biases: how these can unconsciously affect modelling and assumption choices, and how to counteract them 
Default model calibrations, including use of models from other territories: ensuring someone else is not making key choices for you 
The session would be of interest to actuaries at all levels with an interest in setting assumptions, whether from the perspective of research, pricing or valuation. Some awareness of basic longevity concepts would be helpful, as longevity assumptions will be used to illustrate these topics, but this is not essential.

The global economy’s tectonic plates are shifting: an abrupt re-ordering of world trade is underway. 4most’s Chief Economist Keith Church, Government Actuarial Department’s Investment Lead Christophor Ward, and 4most’s Associate Partner Dharmesh Roopun will trace the shock waves.  
The steep, blunt levies show Washington now treats trade deficits as subsidies to foreign governments, aiming to erase them. The adjustment – the rest of the world consuming more, exporting less – will hurt. China must find new markets and the US must consume less and invest more of its domestic resources. Transition may bring temporary US inflation but deflationary forces elsewhere. European central banks will act to avert recession. Crucially, investment flows mirror trade reordering: a smaller US trade deficit means less overseas financing for its huge fiscal gap. Higher US yields amid looming recession illustrate the dangers: what does this mean for bond yields? 
Against that unsettled horizon, Chris Ward (GAD) will present recent works on advising government departments as they set policy, especially with regards to productive assets such as in the energy and carbon capture space. Leveraging their knowledge on funding models and economic scenarios, Chris will set out how the organisation is empowering officials with actuarial analysis and governance support. That in turn helps evaluation of productive investment opportunities leading to positive impacts for investors and society.

Model risk management (MRM) is a well-established practice, with actuaries deeply familiar with the fundamental concepts. Traditionally, the focus of MRM in insurers has been on financial reporting and capital models, especially for internal model firms. 
But the use of models extends far beyond financial reporting. Models support a wide range of critical decisions across the organisation and errors can have a disproportionate impact on customers. Yet the approach for managing model risks in areas outside financial reporting varies significantly and they are often only scrutinised after costly errors have surfaced.

This session examines how AI-driven predictive models built on wearable data can dramatically improve mortality risk stratification compared to traditional methods based on static metrics.  
We will highlight insights from recent collaborations with Willis Towers Watson (WTW) and Munich Re Life. For example, daily step count has emerged as a more powerful predictor of mortality risk than many conventional factors (second only to age). A wearable-data-driven model outperformed one using traditional underwriting inputs in stratifying mortality risk. These findings reveal that active lifestyle indicators can trump classical risk factors – for example, smokers averaging 7,000+ steps per day exhibit lower mortality rates than sedentary non-smokers.  
Attendees will learn how incorporating wearable-derived measures (such as steps, heart rate, and sleep patterns) into underwriting can enhance accuracy, expand insurability, and encourage healthier customer behaviours.

Following a well-received session at last year’s IFoA Life Conference, the IFoA Social Care Working Party returns to share our significant progress and ongoing work in this vital and evolving policy area. Since our last presentation, we have submitted evidence to the House of Commons inquiry on The Cost of Inaction and continued developing our actuarial modelling framework to support long-term care policy and product design. 
This year, we will present our work on constructing a set of actuarial assumptions, incidence and transition rates, that reflect how individuals in their 50s and 60s may move between health states such as: healthy, receiving care at home, in residential care, or requiring nursing care. These assumptions will feed into a multi-state model designed to estimate the future cost of care across different settings. 
The model has multiple potential applications. It can support the development and pricing of pre-funded insurance products (for example policies that pay benefits when care needs arise), as well as enhance government planning and cost modelling for state-provided care. Crucially, it allows for assessment of the impact of preventative measures, enabling cost-benefit analysis of social care policy options. 
This session contributes meaningfully to the broader debate on social care reform. It provides an evidence-based, actuarial approach that is aligned with, and can inform, the recommendations of the Casey Commission on adult social care reform in England. Importantly, it ensures that actuaries are recognised as key contributors to this complex debate on one of society’s most pressing challenges.

Recent years have brought an extensive and wide-ranging portfolio of regulatory reform, which have fundamentally impacted the business model of insurers.  This talk will reflect on the impacts of recent policy changes such as Solvency UK, matching adjustment, funded re, solvent exit, and liquidity reporting, and ask two questions: 
Have the changes prompted the intended changes? 
How can firms maximise benefit from the reforms?

Session: Workshop C8: What next for regulatory reform? 
Details: 
Recent years have brought an extensive and wide-ranging portfolio of regulatory reform, which have fundamentally impacted the business model of insurers.  This talk will reflect on the impacts of recent policy changes such as Solvency UK, matching adjustment, funded re, solvent exit, and liquidity reporting, and ask two questions: 
Have the changes prompted the intended changes? 
How can firms maximise benefit from the reforms?

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, have rapidly moved from diabetes treatment into mainstream use for obesity, with prescription rates soaring. But their impact extends far beyond weight loss. These drugs are now demonstrating a broad spectrum of health benefits. Large-scale clinical trials have shown significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and strokes – benefits that appear to be independent of weight loss alone. 
Crucially, GLP-1 RAs are being explored as possible anti-ageing therapeutics. By addressing key biological drivers of ageing such as inflammation, insulin resistance, and cellular stress, these drugs may compress morbidity, delay onset of chronic diseases, and shift long-term health trajectories. This raises crucial questions for actuaries and life insurers. For example, will widespread uptake of GLP-1 RAs affect population-level mortality improvement rates? What timescales are we working with? Could we see a meaningful increase in healthy life expectancy?

The ‘dash for cash’ in March 2020 and the liability-driven investment (LDI) crisis in September 2022 were significant market stress events. They shone a spotlight on the critical importance of robust liquidity risk management and reporting.  
The Prudential Regulation Authority’s response has involved proposals to enhance liquidity reporting requirements. This would require the largest life insurers to materially increase the granularity, frequency, and timeliness of liquidity reporting. The proposals are broadly leveraged from the liquidity reporting framework for banks. While the industries are different, there are valuable lessons to learn from the banking industry’s decade-long liquidity reporting journey.

2025-11-06,16:40 - 17:25,Workshop E3 | Protection health and care,Reducing morbidity risk in a changing climate: forecasting the impact of emerging health threats ,"
As climate change accelerates the emergence of climate-sensitive infectious diseases,  
including arboviruses like dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile virus, European populations are becoming increasingly exposed to morbidity risks historically confined to tropical regions. These expanding threats challenge long-standing actuarial assumptions in life and health insurance.  
Accurate forecasting of these evolving threats requires the integration of genomic, epidemiological, and eco-epidemiological data using machine learning approaches. By combining real-time genomic surveillance with climate indicators, land use, and human mobility patterns, it is now possible to identify regions at increased risk of outbreaks, enhancing the management of climate change-induced morbidity risks in a data-driven way. 
Machine learning models grounded in high-resolution interdisciplinary datasets enable early warning systems that forecast morbidity risk with improved spatial and temporal precision. These tools provide a quantitative foundation to refine actuarial models and support adaptive, forward-looking strategies.  
As climate-sensitive pathogens expand, forecasting approaches offer insurers a scalable way to anticipate and mitigate emerging morbidity risks across Europe. 
This sessions is aimed at actuaries keen to reflect climate change in risk management, and who are looking into novel ways to assess and quantify climate change-induced risks.

Session: Workshop E3 | Protection health and care: Reducing morbidity risk in a changing climate: forecasting the impact of emerging health threats 
Details: 
As climate change accelerates the emergence of climate-sensitive infectious diseases,  
including arboviruses like dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile virus, European populations are becoming increasingly exposed to morbidity risks historically confined to tropical regions. These expanding threats challenge long-standing actuarial assumptions in life and health insurance.  
Accurate forecasting of these evolving threats requires the integration of genomic, epidemiological, and eco-epidemiological data using machine learning approaches. By combining real-time genomic surveillance with climate indicators, land use, and human mobility patterns, it is now possible to identify regions at increased risk of outbreaks, enhancing the management of climate change-induced morbidity risks in a data-driven way. 
Machine learning models grounded in high-resolution interdisciplinary datasets enable early warning systems that forecast morbidity risk with improved spatial and temporal precision. These tools provide a quantitative foundation to refine actuarial models and support adaptive, forward-looking strategies.  
As climate-sensitive pathogens expand, forecasting approaches offer insurers a scalable way to anticipate and mitigate emerging morbidity risks across Europe. 
This sessions is aimed at actuaries keen to reflect climate change in risk management, and who are looking into novel ways to assess and quantify climate change-induced risks.

2025-11-06,16:40 - 17:25,Workshop E4,Quantum computing for actuaries: A practical primer ,"
Quantum computing opens an entirely new horizon for actuaries. Despite their reputation, quantum concepts can be surprisingly intuitive when framed in actuarial contexts. This introductory session will leverage actuarial analogies and practical examples to clarify core quantum concepts:
Qubits and Quantum circuits: What are they, and how are they used to encode and process information?
Superposition: Actuarial analogies like Schrödinger’s Policyholder, where a life simultaneously embodies survival and death probabilities.
Entanglement: Illustrating correlated risks like joint-lives, where the state of one qubit immediately informs about another.
Quantum Encoding: Representing entire life tables efficiently with just a handful of qubits, drastically reducing computational and memory requirements.
Quantum Valuation: Annuity and Option valuation using quantum computers.
Quantum Hardware demo: Running calculations on real quantum hardware. 
Inspired by recent actuarial-focused quantum research published in the British Actuarial Journal, attendees will develop foundational quantum literacy, practical familiarity with quantum methods relevant to actuarial work, and actionable insights into integrating quantum tools into their analytical toolbox.

Climate change is not only an environmental crisis but also a significant driver of social and economic inequality. As the global community accelerates efforts to decarbonise economies, the concept of a ‘just transition’ has emerged, emphasising the need for fairness in distributing the burdens and benefits of climate action. This presentation examines the intersection of climate risk, inequality, just transition, and actuarial science, drawing on the paper ‘Climate Inequality and Just Transition’ by the IFoA Inequality of Climate Change Working Party.  We will explore how climate change disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations and how transition policies can either mitigate or exacerbate existing inequalities. It will highlight regulatory and public interest considerations from a life insurance perspective, including the impacts on implicit scenario assumptions, and its relevance to IFoA risk alerts and consumer duty. By connecting these issues to broader economic and political contexts, attendees will see how awareness of climate justice impacts life actuaries’ work and aids the alignment with government objectives on domestic economic growth. 
The session will highlight the importance of a just transition for all, including those who are at the more privileged side of the inequalities. Finally, attendees will gain insights into the ethical responsibilities of actuaries and the vital role of equity in advancing climate solutions.

The CMI mortality projections model was first released in 2009 and is the UK industry model for assessing future mortality improvements. The COVID-19 pandemic posed a unique challenge for the CMI and other data-driven models, as this turbulent period for mortality was unlikely to be indicative of future trends.  
The latest version of the model, CMI_2024, contains the most fundamental changes to the model structure since CMI_2016 to deal with this issue, namely: 
Extending the existing age-period-cohort improvement to have three period terms, to reflect different trends in mortality at different ages, rather than one as in earlier versions of the model 
Modelling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality by adding a “fitted overlay” to the APCI model, rather than using weights as in earlier versions 
Applying cohort constraints after fitting the model, rather than as part of the fitting process, to avoid distorting cohort components at intermediate ages 
Changing the algorithm used to fit the model to be quicker and more robust.

While actuarial teams are skilled in analytical thinking and technical delivery, questions about collaboration, communication, team culture and dynamics often remain unspoken. These challenges significantly influence performance, impact, and the ability to drive real change. In this session, we’ll explore important questions such as: 
How can systemic coaching support high-performing, outcome-focused teams? 
What helps break down silos and create a collaborative culture? 
How do we influence mindset and improve communication without losing accountability? 
This highly participative workshop will blend insights from disciplines of high-performing teams, developing thinking environments, and Linda Gratton’s work on Redesigning Work. 
Target audience: Actuaries, team leaders, and professionals at all levels with an interest in improving how teams work, not just what they deliver.

Recent regulatory changes, including the FCA’s consumer duty requirements, have had a significant impact on Part VII transfers. This session looks at these and their effect on transfers, including as a case study a recent successful transfer. 
Key outcomes from the session include: 
Understanding the current environment for Part VII transfers 
What the transferor and transferee consider before entering into a Part VII transfer. 
The impact of the consumer duty regulations on the transferor, transferee and the independent expert for a Part VII transfer 
How dependencies, in particular those that impact policyholders, can complicate a transfer.  
How sanctions can cause difficulties 
What do good policyholder communications look like? 
How to have a successful transfer. 
For the case study, the speakers were the Chief Actuary at the transferee, Chesnara plc, and the independent expert. 
The session is aimed at those interested in Part VII transfers and will assume a basic knowledge of UK insurance regulation. It will also be of interest to anyone involved with looking at the impact of consumer duty on customers, and more broadly keeping up to date with regulatory changes and practice.

The PRA has a continued focus on liquidity management and reporting for life insurers. In March 2025, the consultation period for ‘CP19/24 – Closing liquidity reporting gaps and streamlining Standard Formula reporting’ closed, and the current expectation is that firms will need to implement the reporting proposals by 31 December 2025. In addition to the new reporting requirements, the regulator’s existing expectations for a robust liquidity risk management framework are set out in SS5/19, with the PRA indicating that this remains an area of focus in its 2025 insurance supervisory priorities.
In this session we will consider three key areas: 
An overview of the reporting requirements outlined in CP19/24 and of the areas of challenge being observed across the market, and actions being taken by firms to meet the reporting requirements
A summary of current liquidity risk management practices being adopted by firms, which will be supported by findings from a survey that will be published in 2025 by the working party  
Consideration of the key interactions between the existing liquidity risk management metrics and the information that is being presented within the PRA reporting templates. This will consider areas of consistency and differences and the risks or opportunities that this may present to firms.

2025-11-07,09:55 - 10:40,Workshop G2,ORSA scenarios and the implications of sustainability-driven inflation ,"
ORSA solvency assessments depend on ""extreme but plausible scenarios"", yet few foresaw the COVID shutdown, Truss Crash, or Russia-Ukraine war’s effects on energy and the cost of living.
Considering these events from the past five years, are our extreme calibrations still relevant, or do we need a ""new plausible""?  Climate change and the sustainability transition are known unknowns poised to impact future economies, but their effects are often under-estimated and under-reported. The 2024 IFoA Risk Alert advised actuaries to consider whether a realistic worst-case scenario might surpass current climate scenarios.  
The current PRA consultation paper CP10/25 highlights the need to consider limitations, non-linearities and tipping points. It also requires consideration of whether the climate scenario represents a 'central' or 'stress case'.  However, data on the stress cases is limited and alternatives to current published scenarios are scarce. Few studies have examined how sustainability might influence the broader economy and key actuarial macroeconomic factors like inflation and interest rates.   This presentation will provide insights from our 2025 survey of ORSA industry practices, focusing on sustainability and macroeconomic impacts. It will compare current practices with emerging models on sustainability's significant effects on economic variables. The presentation will explore potential gaps in current practice and outline what a realistic ""extreme but plausible"" scenario might entail, offering practical insights and solutions rather than just diagnosing the problem.

2025-11-07,09:55 - 10:40,Workshop G3 | Protection health and care,Genetic testing: the elephant in the room ,"
Sequencing of the entire human genome was first completed in 2003, at a cost of $2.7 billion. However, the costs have fallen dramatically to now well below £1,000 and as a result we have witnessed a large number of companies offering genome sequencing services, although for some their ‘success’ has been short lived.  
There is no doubt that genetic testing is a challenging area for the health insurance industry. Insurers are precluded from using the outputs from genetic testing in all but very limited circumstances, creating the risk of adverse selection. For an individual, understanding your genetic predisposition to certain diseases without adequate support introduces its own moral hazards.  
Bupa is helping people around the world to live longer and healthier lives. Seeing genomics as a key pillar in this mission, in October 2024 it announced the pilot of whole-genome sequencing for selected UK customers.

The IFoA trains actuaries to think rigorously about risk, value, and long-term outcomes. For two centuries, actuaries have used these skills in life insurance workflows that include pricing, reserving, and risk management. However, the world is evolving rapidly, with innovation and customer experience becoming critical to the success of life insurers. This has coincided or resulted in the reduction of statutory actuarial sign-off requirements, the automation of several actuarial processes, and the introduction of AI into actuarial work.  
This shift creates an opportunity for actuaries to broaden their influence in other domains that utilise their skills, such as product management.
